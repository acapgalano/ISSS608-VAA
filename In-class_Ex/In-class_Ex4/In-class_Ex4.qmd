## üîç Overview

This document serves as my In-class Exercise 4 requirement, following the fourth week of ISSS608 VAA lecture of Professor Kam on February 4, 2023.

## Getting Started 

### Installing packages into the R environment

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, DT, patchwork, crosstalk, tidyverse)
```

### Loading the data into the R environment

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## Exploring the `plotly` Package

### Creating our first basic plot

```{r}
plot_ly(
  data = exam_data,
  x = ~ENGLISH,
  y = ~MATHS,
  color = ~RACE
)
```
