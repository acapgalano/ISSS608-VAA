    "text": "The pattern of the population pyramids\nWhile each pyramid has slight differences, a recurring observation from each pyramid is that the larger populations are around the middle ages (40-70s). According to National Geographic, this type is called ‚ÄúConstrictive‚Äù and means that these areas have relatively low fertility rates and high life expectancy. The trend states that the population is aging.\nTaking a look at some specific age-sex pyramids, we observe that Punggol has the most unique shape. Since Punggol is relatively newer in the township development aspect, it makes sense that mostly people in their late 30‚Äôs to early 40‚Äôs are moving there. It is reportedly popular for homebuyers, which people in their 20‚Äôs are usually not. With this, it also makes sense that these people are starting their families, therefore younger children are more present than teens and young adults.\nThough on opposite sides of Singapore, Bedok and Jurong West are the closest to having a perfect constrictive shape. Bedok is a mature residential estate and Jurong West is non-mature."

    "text": "What this means for Singapore\nConstrictive population pyramids are usually a sign of a developed country with high economic development. Good healthcare leads to higher life expectancy and quality education is linked to lower fertility rates. However, with the aging population comes concerns about caring for the elderly and the eventual lack of manpower.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Singapore population and growth rate from WorldOMeter\n\n\nAs suggested by the pyramids, the growth rate of Singapore is slowing down. This is confirmed by the population and growth rate graphs above. For the population graph, we can see that the curve is slowly flattening out. The growth rate is explicitly dropping since before 2010. Measures may need to be taken to encourage an increase in fertility rates."
