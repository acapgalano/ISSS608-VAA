    "text": "The pattern of the population pyramids\nWhile each pyramid has slight differences, a recurring observation from each pyramid is that the larger populations are around the middle ages (40-70s). According to National Geographic, this type is called ‚ÄúConstrictive‚Äù and means that these areas have relatively low fertility rates and high life expectancy. The trend states that the population is aging.\nTaking a look at some specific age-sex pyramids, we observe that Punggol has the most unique shape. Since Punggol is relatively newer in the township development aspect, it makes sense that mostly people in their late 30‚Äôs to early 40‚Äôs are moving there. It is reportedly popular for homebuyers, which people in their 20‚Äôs are usually not. With this, it also makes sense that these people are starting their families, therefore younger children are more present than teens and young adults.\nThough on opposite sides of Singapore, Bedok and Jurong West are the closest to having a perfect constrictive shape. Bedok is a mature residential estate and Jurong West is non-mature."

However, with the aging population comes concerns about caring for the elderly and the eventual lack of manpower.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Singapore population and growth rate from WorldOMeter\n\n\nAs suggested by the pyramids, the growth rate of Singapore is slowing down. This is confirmed by the population and growth rate graphs above. For the population graph, we can see that the curve is slowly flattening out. The growth rate is explicitly dropping since before 2010. Measures may need to be taken to encourage an increase in fertility rates."

But first, let‚Äôs look at the positives.\n\nIt was my first time seeing an age-sex pyramid with the total as a shadow behind the bars to use as comparison. There was also a pyramid for the total of SG, and a bar graph representing the population of the planning areas presented. In general, the creator wanted to give as much information as possible.\nThe colors used to color the bars according to sex are ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù in a sense that it‚Äôs easy to comprehend what they represent.\nThe creator followed the guideline from the class where categorical variables should not make use of tick marks.\n\nWith that, I have the following critiques to make:\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot, arguably too much, going on. There‚Äôs a lot of graphs, a lot of bars, and lots of numbers that aren‚Äôt very clear. The numerical labels also tend to block the visuals of the bar graph, making it hard to distinguish the edges. For the sake of the assignment as well, it does not seem necessary to include the age-sex pyramid of the whole Singapore, and population of each planning area. The gray bars seem to be the total population of each age group used to compare to each of the sexes, however, it also seems very unnecessary to the purpose of the age-sex pyramid. The label of ‚ÄúPlanning Area‚Äù is also just taking up space, but it should be clear that the strip names are the planning areas from the title.\n\nThe unit of measurement. While there are age-sex pyramids that use the actual population values, it may be easier to digest percentages compared to looking at large values. It also helps the axis labels look cleaner. Using percentages should not take away from the structure of the pyramid.\nThe trellis chart is one row and affects the pyramids. Because all nine age-sex pyramids are lined up in a row, the bars become compressed. They now give the wrong impression, appearing more like a ‚Äústationary‚Äù structure rather than ‚Äúconstrictive- basically it affects the shape, therefore affecting the interpretation.\nThe ‚ÄòAge Group‚Äô axis labels. While still very much readable, the presence of the underscores (‚Äò_‚Äô) are unsightly.\n\nWith these in mind, we can start building our new age-sex pyramid trellis chart.\n\n\nChanging the unit of measurement\nIn order to get change the axis to percentages, there are some revisions to be made to our top_9_data tibble. By using aggregate() we can get the total population for each planning area. After joining that tibble to top_9_data to add a ‚ÄòTotal‚Äô column, we can add a new column using mutate() that computes for the ‚ÄòPercentage‚Äô using ‚ÄòPop‚Äô over ‚ÄòTotal‚Äô.\n\n\nPress to toggle code\ntop_9_sum <- setNames(aggregate(x = top_9_data$Pop,\n                            by = list(top_9_data$PA),\n                            FUN = sum),\n                            c(\"PA\",\"Total\"))\n\ntop_9_data <- top_9_data %>% \n        left_join(top_9_sum, \n                  by='PA') %>% \n        mutate(`Percentage` = `Pop`/`Total`)\n\nglimpse(top_9_data)\n\n\nRows: 342\nColumns: 6\nGroups: PA, AG [171]\n$ PA         <chr> \"Bedok\", \"Bedok\", \"Bedok\", \"Bedok\", \"Bedok\", \"Bedok\", \"Bedo‚Ä¶\n$ AG         <chr> \"0_to_4\", \"0_to_4\", \"10_to_14\", \"10_to_14\", \"15_to_19\", \"15‚Ä¶\n$ Sex        <chr> \"Females\", \"Males\", \"Females\", \"Males\", \"Females\", \"Males\",‚Ä¶\n$ Pop        <dbl> 4970, 5090, 6220, 6440, 6660, 6770, 7310, 7860, 8820, 9060,‚Ä¶\n$ Total      <dbl> 278640, 278640, 278640, 278640, 278640, 278640, 278640, 278‚Ä¶\n$ Percentage <dbl> 0.01783664, 0.01826730, 0.02232271, 0.02311226, 0.02390181,‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüíªCODE REVIEW!\n\n\n\nThe function glimpse is used to present each column in the dataframe.\n\n\n\n\nFixing the Age Group values\nBy running the function str_replace(), we change the substring ‚Äú_to_‚Äù to ‚Äù - ‚Äú, effectively removing the underscores. We also change‚Äù90_and_over‚Äù to ‚Äú> 90‚Äù for easy comprehension.\n\n\nPress to toggle code\ntop_9_data$AG <- str_replace(top_9_data$AG, \"_to_\", \" - \")\n\ntop_9_data$AG <- str_replace(top_9_data$AG, \"90_and_over\", \"> 90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the base age-sex pyramid\nThe code chunk below gets us started with building our age-sex pyramid. Each geom_bar() is divided into a subset that is filtered by sex. We use coord_flip() to reverse the x and y axis.\n\n\nPress to toggle code\nggplot(top_9_data, aes(x = AG, \n                       y = Percentage, \n                       fill = Sex)) + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Males\"), \n           stat = 'identity') + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Females\"), \n           stat = 'identity') +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have the issue of the two bars representing males and females overlapping each other. To solve this, we change the ‚ÄòPercentage‚Äô values for ‚ÄúMales‚Äù to be negative using the code chunk below.\n\n\nPress to toggle code\ntop_9_data <- top_9_data %>%\n  mutate(Percentage = ifelse(Sex == \"Males\", \n                             -Percentage, \n                             Percentage))\nhead(top_9_data)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 √ó 6\n# Groups:   PA, AG [3]\n  PA    AG      Sex       Pop  Total Percentage\n  <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <dbl>  <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 Bedok 0 - 4   Males    5090 278640    -0.0183\n2 Bedok 0 - 4   Females  4970 278640     0.0178\n3 Bedok 5 - 9   Males    5960 278640    -0.0214\n4 Bedok 5 - 9   Females  5700 278640     0.0205\n5 Bedok 10 - 14 Males    6440 278640    -0.0231\n6 Bedok 10 - 14 Females  6220 278640     0.0223\n\n\nThere‚Äôs also the issue of the age group ‚Äú5-9‚Äù appearing between ‚Äú45-49‚Äù and ‚Äú50-54‚Äù due to alphabetical sorting of the strings. To fix this, we declare a vector with the right arrangement of the age group categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüå∏ PERSONAL COMMENTS!\n\n\n\nThis was not done manually. I ran unique(top_9_data$AG), copy-pasted it and moved ‚Äú5-9‚Äù to the right position.\n\n\n\n\nPress to toggle code\nAG_sort = c(\"0 - 4\",\"5 - 9\",\"10 - 14\", \"15 - 19\", \"20 - 24\", \"25 - 29\", \"30 - 34\", \"35 - 39\", \"40 - 44\", \"45 - 49\",\"50 - 54\",\"55 - 59\",\"60 - 64\",\"65 - 69\",\"70 - 74\",\"75 - 79\", \"80 - 84\",\"85 - 89\",\"> 90\")\n\n\nNow with the changes made above, we can try running our ggplot model again with a few new changes. First we have scale_y_continuous() which we use to fix the percentage labels. Then we have scale_x_discrete() to set ‚Äòlimits‚Äô to follow AG_sort.\n\n\nPress to toggle code\nggplot(top_9_data, aes(x = AG, \n                       y = Percentage, \n                       fill = Sex)) + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Males\"), \n           stat = 'identity') + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Females\"), \n           stat = 'identity') +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(abs(x*100), \n                                     \"%\"),\n                    limits = c(-0.6, 0.6)) + # new \n  scale_x_discrete(limits = AG_sort) + # new\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a 3x3 trellis chart\nNow we‚Äôre ready to turn our single row trellis chart to one that is distributed evenly as a 3x3 chart. Fortunately, ggplot2 provides a function called facet_wrap() which allows us to generate panels for each planning area.\n\n\nPress to toggle code\nggplot(top_9_data, aes(x = AG, \n                       y = Percentage, \n                       fill = Sex)) + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Males\"), \n           stat = 'identity') + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Females\"), \n           stat = 'identity') +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(abs(x*100), \"%\"),\n                        limits = c(-0.06, 0.06)) + \n  scale_x_discrete(limits = AG_sort) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  facet_wrap(~ PA, nrow = 3) # newly added line\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can clearly see the shape of each of the pyramids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüñäÔ∏è TAKE NOTE!\n\n\n\nAt this point the upper limit for scale_y_continuous() was set to 0.06 instead of 0.6 since the scales would be per planning area already. By running max() on the ‚ÄòPercentage‚Äô column, we get that the highest value and between 5-6%, therefore we set the upper limit to 0.06.\n\n\n\n\nFixing axis and legend details\nThe ‚ÄòAge Group‚Äô labels seem to be a bit too compressed. Our legend is also unnecessarily large. Using theme() and setting element_text() we can format the different text in our chart. Also under theme(), we can set axis.ticks.y = element_blank() in order to remove the tick marks on the ‚ÄòAge Group‚Äô axis since it is a categorical variable.\n\n\nPress to toggle code\nggplot(top_9_data, aes(x = AG, \n                       y = Percentage, \n                       fill = Sex)) + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Males\"), \n           stat = 'identity') + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Females\"), \n           stat = 'identity') +\n  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(abs(x*100), \"%\"),\n                    limits = c(-0.06, 0.06),\n                    breaks = seq(-0.06,0.06, by = 0.02)) + \n  scale_x_discrete(limits = AG_sort) +\n  \n  coord_flip() + \n  \n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 7),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 9),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 9),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) + \n  \n  xlab(\"Age Group\") + \n  \n  facet_wrap(~ PA, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a title and caption\nThis is an important part of any graph, chart or visualization. While it‚Äôs important to show and not tell, it‚Äôs important to set the context of what the person is viewing. Using labs() we can set the ‚Äòtitle‚Äô, ‚Äòsubtitle‚Äô and ‚Äòcaption‚Äô as shown.\n\n\nPress to toggle code\nggplot(top_9_data, aes(x = AG, \n                       y = Percentage, \n                       fill = Sex)) + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Males\"), \n           stat = 'identity') + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Females\"), \n           stat = 'identity') +\n  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(abs(x*100), \"%\"),\n                    limits = c(-0.06, 0.06),\n                    breaks = seq(-0.06,0.06, by = 0.02)) + \n  scale_x_discrete(limits = AG_sort) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  \n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 7),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 9),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 9),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 14,\n                                  face = \"bold\"), # new\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), #new\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 6), #new\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 8)) +  #new\n  \n  xlab(\"Age Group\") + \n  ylab(\"Percentage (%)\") + \n  labs(title = \"Age-Sex Pyramid of Top 9 Most Populated Planning Areas, 2022\", #new\n       subtitle = \"Age group distribution of percentage population for males and females in nine of the most populated planning areas in Singapore\", #new\n       caption =\"Data Source: Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 (Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS))\")  + #new\n  facet_wrap(~ PA, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the theme to be more visually appealing\nBy adding theme_bw() (from the given theme elements) we get a cleaner grid and sharper panels. The fill colors for the ‚ÄòSex‚Äô were also changed using scale_fill_manual(). Finally, an additional argument was added to the geom_bar() objects called ‚Äôcolor‚Äô which adds borders to the bars to look more defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüñäÔ∏è TAKE NOTE!\n\n\n\nThe order of the placement of theme_bw() or any other pre-made theme elements could ruin your customized formats. In this case, I placed it before theme(), otherwise it would override the changes I made to the title and subtitle text.\n\n\n\n\nPress to toggle code\nggplot(top_9_data, aes(x = AG, \n                       y = Percentage, \n                       fill = Sex)) + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Males\"), \n           stat = 'identity',\n           color = 'black') +  # new\n  geom_bar(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Females\"), \n           stat = 'identity',\n           color = 'black') +  # new \n  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(abs(x*100), \"%\"),\n                    limits = c(-0.06, 0.06),\n                    breaks = seq(-0.06,0.06, by = 0.02)) + \n  scale_x_discrete(limits = AG_sort) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  \n  theme_bw() + # new\n  \n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 9),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 10),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 15,\n                                  face = \"bold\"), \n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11,\n                                     face = \"italic\"), \n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 7), \n        strip.text = element_text(size = 10)) +  \n  \n  xlab(\"Age Group\") + \n  ylab(\"Percentage (%)\") + \n  labs(title = \"Age-Sex Pyramid of Top 9 Most Populated Planning Areas, 2022\", \n       subtitle = \"Age group distribution of percentage population for males and females in nine of the most populated planning areas in Singapore\", \n       caption =\"Data Source: Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 (Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS))\")  + \n\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#ff63a4\", # new\n                             \"#2d74f7\")) + # new\n  facet_wrap(~ PA, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this we have our final product.

    "text": "üí¨ Remarks, Doubts and Recommendations\n\nI limited the exercise scope to just the trellis chart and did not include the full Singapore pyramid and planning area population bar graphs.\nI originally wanted to recreate the entire graph of whichever Take-home Exercise 1 I would choose, but then I realized at some point that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to fully recreate them in R (or at least I wouldn‚Äôt know how to). And so I opted to just build from the ground up.\nIt was only after I had worked on the code that I realized we were ideally not supposed to make any changes to the dataset. I‚Äôm unsure if converting to percentages counts, but if it does, then that was my mistake.\nIf this were not a trellis chart, it may be possible to explore placing the ‚ÄòAge Group‚Äô axis in between the Males and Females bars. However, in a trellis chart, it may seem repetitive to have it in every panel.\nAnother thing that I feel like would be okay if not for the trellis chart format is adding the percentage labels. I opted to not add it now because the graphs would seem too cluttered and the labels would likely not be very visible.

By setting the ‚Äòsubtitle‚Äô to ‚Äòelement_markdown()‚Äô in theme(), we can set the color of different text snippets in subtitle. The legend was also removed by setting legend.position = \"none\".\nOne thing I initially thought would help with easily understanding the population structure was by adding geom_rect() objects as background colors symbolizing a classification of age groups. For example if we follow the definitions in this article on age group classification, then we‚Äôd have 0‚Äì14‚Äâyears old (pediatric group), 15‚Äì47‚Äâyears old (youth group), 48‚Äì63‚Äâyears old (middle-aged group), and‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ64‚Äâyears old (elderly group). The background would then be colored behind the bars according to the groupings to easily identify which age group classification has more or less populations. However, I went against this because I thought having a plot with too many colors and filled in every space with colors would be too painful to the eyes.\nIn relation to the point above, I also considered including the age dependency ratio and/or child dependency ratio at the side of each pyramid.\nLastly, given our recent lesson on interactivity, we can also apply tooltips to the bars for easy comprehension. A simple example is given below produced by ggiraph. The tooltip presents the sex, age group, percentage and population. (Figure adjustments using special Quarto syntax seem to not affect this figure so work needs to be done to adjust the plot.)\n\n\n\nPress to toggle code\npacman::p_load(ggiraph)\n\ng <- ggplot(top_9_data, aes(x = AG, \n                       y = Percentage, \n                       fill = Sex)) + \n  geom_bar_interactive(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Males\"), \n           stat = 'identity',\n           color = 'black',\n           size = 0.2,\n           aes(tooltip = paste0(\"Males \\n\",\n                                \"Age Group: \",\n                                AG,\n                                \"\\n Percentage: \", \n                                sprintf(\"%0.2f\", \n                                round(abs(Percentage)*100, \n                                digits = 2)),\n                                \"% \\n Population: \",\n                                Pop))) + \n  geom_bar_interactive(data = subset(top_9_data, \n                         Sex == \"Females\"), \n           stat = 'identity',\n           color = 'black',\n           size = 0.2,\n           aes(tooltip = paste0(\"Females \\n\",\n                                \"Age Group: \",\n                                AG,\n                                \"\\n Percentage: \", \n                                sprintf(\"%0.2f\", \n                                round(Percentage*100, \n                                digits = 2)),\n                                \"% \\n Population: \",\n                                Pop))) +\n  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(abs(x*100), \"%\"),\n                    limits = c(-0.06, 0.06),\n                    breaks = seq(-0.06,0.06, by = 0.02)) + \n  scale_x_discrete(limits = AG_sort) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  \n  theme_bw() + \n  \n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 5),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 7),\n        legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 11,\n                                  face = \"bold\"), \n        plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 6,\n                                     face = \"italic\"), \n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 4), \n        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.2), \n        panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 6,\n                                  margin = margin(0.1,0,0.1,0, \"cm\"))) +  \n  xlab(\"Age Group\") + \n  ylab(\"Percentage (%)\") + \n  labs(title = \"Age-Sex Pyramid of Top 9 Most Populated Planning Areas, 2022\", \n       subtitle = \"Age group distribution of percentage population for <span style='color:#2d74f7;'>males</span> and <span style='color:#ff63a4;'>females</span> in nine of the most populated planning areas in Singapore\", \n       caption =\"Data Soruce: Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 (Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS))\")  + \n\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#ff63a4\", \n                             \"#2d74f7\")) + \n  facet_wrap(~ PA, nrow = 3)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = g,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 8.5*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, a lot is possible with R.
